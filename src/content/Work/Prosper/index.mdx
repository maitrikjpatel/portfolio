## Problem/Goal:
Prosper.com is a peer to peer lending marketplace that provides convenient and low-cost loans to consumers — and allows individuals to invest in these loans. 

Prosper always required to maintain balance between borrowers and investors for sustainable business.

Prosper required to develop redesigned, mobile friendly, easy to navigate and automated investor platfrom to attract more retail investment to fund borrowers' loans.

## Research:

As the needs of investors continue to evolve, two things remain paramount – they want to put their money to work quickly and easily, and see solid returns. And while historically, Prosper has delivered on the promise of attractive returns, the investment site hasn’t always been the easiest to navigate.

## Ideation:

Build Prosper investor’s mobile-friendly site with more powerful, intuitive tools so they can invest more easily, track portfolio performance and reach fixed-income investing goals.

A new cornerstone feature of the platform is Auto Invest, a straightforward and easy-to-use tool that enables customers to automatically purchase Notes based on their personal investment criteria.

## Deliverables:

Developed Prosper Living Style-guide with reusable visual elements and angular directives using Fabricator, AnuglarJS, webpack, foundation 6 and SASS which used for Prosper redesign and rebrand. 

Worked in an Agile development environment using Test Driven Development concepts, SEO friendly, W3C standards, and A/B testing concepts.

Gathered requirements from the UX and documenting it to estimate and analyzing specifications and the time for UI architecture development, to support the growing feature set of investor product, and deliver a delightful user experience to customers.
