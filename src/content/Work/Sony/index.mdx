### 

- I was working as Front End Developer at Sony’s global web transformation project.

- The new European Sony website is considered one of the largest responsive design efforts undertaken in the digital space today. The new site uses cutting edge web technologies and is fully responsive across a wide variety of devices and platforms – in addition to being translated into 49 countries and 27 languages, for a total of 52 sites. My work included adding features via HTML5/CSS3/JS development, platform support, bugfixing, and assisting UX and design teams in planning upcoming feature enhancements.

- Responsibilities: Hand-coded custom modules, added global features, managed codebase, & debugged the site across multiple locales. I was responsible to gather requirements from the  creative team to estimate and analyze specifications time for development along with working in the agile scrum process. Participant in agile environment practice with weekly sprints, daily scrums, Jira tracking, and retrospectives.
