## Problem/Goal:
Define the DocuSign Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.

## Research:
- We get together to map out how developers use and contribute to Olive so we can refine and communicate our process to the organization with the ultimate goal of increasing the efficiency of Olive and feature dev teams.
- Align on an end-to-end process map of what it’s like to use Olive as a developer from first day on the job to shipping a finished feature. 
- Identify friction points in the flow.
- Propose and rank potential solutions to friction points.
- Review and prioritize backlog of solutions for the coming quarter.
- Building design systems that help products solve problems at scale.
