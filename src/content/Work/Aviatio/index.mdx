- Aviatio is a desktop and tablet app that allows users to explore data on flight and airport performance across the U.S. It’s a pretty simple interface: you select a region and then a state to view a state-specific dashboard.

- We developed this to showcase certain aspects of Actuate’s REST API library and also to demonstrate how BIRT technology could be used in a cross-device, responsive design.

- The little airplane animation on the loading screen was added after it became clear that the dashboards were taking a long time to generate over remote connections. It’s now the feature that most people tell me they like — rather an unexpected response, but a nice illustration of how a touch of whimsy can elevate an otherwise straightforward app.

- Responsibilities: I was in charge of developing responsive web/mobile application using BIRT REST APIs, HTML, and Java Script for different platforms (mobile, tablet and web). Since this project was medium-small, it was a team of four. I worked closely with visual designer, interaction designer , and back-end engineer.

- Challenges: The most challenging of the project were time and resources. We had four weeks to complete everything. With these constraints, the solution was to design appealing interaction and interface. Every element has purpose at the same time it meets the requirements. The navigation is using live data on iHub. The charts are report content, which showcase product capabilities.
